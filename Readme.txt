needs to be done:
 - write proper readme
 - finish documentation in python code
 - make saving output as JSON file optional
 - general refactoring
 - for return flights calculate travel time in more intelligent way?

 possibly:
 - add different possibilities of ordering (max bags? travel time? number of transfers? )
 - put check_validity_src_dst inside class as method?
 - add baloon text to tkinter
 - completely check one output(python solution.py example/example0m.csv -o ECV -d RFZ -r)
