needs to be done:
 - finish and test command line input
 - write proper readme
 - finish documentation in python code
 - finish readme
 - check that return flights are working as intended
 - make saving output as JSON file optional
 - general refactoring (some functions are huge)

 possibly:
 - add different possibilities of ordering (max bags? travel time? number of transfers? )
